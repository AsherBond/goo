OpenStack Glance And Nova Backed By Red Hat Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this post I will explain how to configure Glance and Nova to be
backed by Red Hat Storage (and thereby gluster).

The ISOs that I link to in this post require a Red Hat Network
subscription.  The information here can be useful without it, but it is
less convenient.

[[]]
Deployment Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In my deployment I use two virtual machines.  One for Red Hat Storage
and the other for all of the OpenStack services (Keystone, Glance, and
Nova).  Both VMs run on my Lenovo T530 laptop which runs Fedora 17.  I
will not go into detail about how to create VMs because that is covered
pretty well in other places, but I will touch on it just to make it as
clear as possible.

[[]]
Red Hat Storage VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the base VM I wanted a lot of space so I created a VM with 48GB of
storage (10 should be plenty) and configured it to have 1GB of RAM and 1
CPU.

1.  Get Red Hat Storage by going
https://rhn.redhat.com/rhn/software/channel/downloads/Download.do?cid=14689[here]
and clicking on _Binary DVD_.
2.  Create a VM with at least 8 GB of storage (mine had 48) and install
Red Hat Storage by following the instructions
https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/2.0/html/Installation_Guide/chap-Installation_Guide-Install_RHS.html#sect-Installation_Guide-Install_RHS-install_frm_iso_1[here]
through step 7.1.
3.  Create a gluster volume with the following commands:

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate------------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
gluster volume create testvol myhost:/exp1
gluster volume start testvol
/etc/init.d/glusterd restart
------------------------------------------

The VM should now be ready to serve a gluster file system.

[[]]
OpenStack VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we will use a single VM for all of the OpenStack services.  The
explanation of how to back either Glance or Nova by gluster will be the
same for a distributed environment.

Create a VM with 8GB of storage using RHEL 6.4 (64 bit) by downloading
the binary DVD available
https://rhn.redhat.com/rhn/software/channel/downloads/Download.do?cid=10156[here]

Install OpenStack by following the instructions
https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_OpenStack_Preview/2/html/Getting_Started_Guide/chapter-Nova.html[here]
through step 6.

At this point you should have a VM which is running enough OpenStack
services to upload VMs, launch them, and ssh into them.  The
instructions referenced above should provide you with steps to verify
this.

note: in selinux I had to run the following command in order to properly
boot images:

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate---------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
setenforce permissive
---------------------

You may also need to open up /etc/nova/nova.conf and make sure you have
the line:

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate-------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
libvirt_type = qemu
-------------------

[[]]
Mount Gluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack VM now needs to mount the storage system provided by Red
Hat Storage so that it can be used by Glance and Nova.  First the VM
must be configured so that the recommend gluster client can be used. 
The instructions for this are
https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/145553[here], but I will
put them in my own words.

Goto
https://access.redhat.com/subscriptions/rhntransition/[https://access.redhat.com/subscriptions/rhntransition]
and navigate: Subscriptions -> RHN Classic -> Registered Systems.

Find your system and click on it.  Click on ‘Alter Channel
Subscriptions” on the new page.  Find _Additional Services Channels for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 for x86_64_  and expand it.  Select_Red Hat
Storage Native Client (RHEL Server 6 for x86_64)_then click the _Update
Subscription_ button.

Now on the OpenStack machine run:

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate--------------------------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
yum install glusterfs-fuse glusterfs
mkdir -p /mnt/gluster/
mount -t glusterfs <storage VM IP>:/testvol /mnt/gluster
--------------------------------------------------------

At this point the OpenStack VM should be able to access the gluster file
system.

[[]]
Configure Glance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to change the path that Glance uses for its file system store
only a single line in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf needs to be changed.

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate-----------------------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
filesystem_store_datadir = /mnt/gluster/glance/images
-----------------------------------------------------

Now run the following commands

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate-------------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
mkdir -p /mnt/gluster/glance/images
chown -R glance:glance /mnt/gluster/glance/
create the directory for the instance store
mkdir /mnt/gluster/instance/
chown -R nova:nova  /mnt/gluster/instance/
service openstack-glance-api restart
-------------------------------------------

At this point glance should be backed by the gluster file system.  Lets
upload a file to glance and verify this.  A good test image is available
http://berrange.fedorapeople.org/images/2012-02-29/f16-x86_64-openstack-sda.qcow2[here].

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
glance image-create --name="test" --is-public=true --container-format=ovf --disk-format=qcow2 < f16-x86_64-openstack-sda.qcow2
ls -l /mnt/gluster/glance/images
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[]]
Configure Nova
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final step is to configure Nova such that nova-compute uses gluster
for its instance store.  The instance store is the temporary area to
which the VM is copied and then booted.  Just as it was with Glance,
configuring nova to use gluster in this way is a simple one line file
change.  Open the file /etc/nova/nova.conf and file the key
_instances_path_.  Change the line to be the following:

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate--------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
instances_path = /mnt/gluster/instance
--------------------------------------

Now setup the correct paths and permissions and restart nova-compute.

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate------------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
mkdir  -p /mnt/gluster/instance/
chown -R nova:nova  /mnt/gluster/instance/
service openstack-nova-compute restart
------------------------------------------

That should be all that is needed.

[[]]
Future Work
~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea behind this is that if Glance and Nova are backed by the same
file system that image propagation should be much faster.  In the future
I will be looking for a testbed where I can verify this.

[[]]
Update
~~~~~~

You should now be able to automatically mount on boot, add the following
to you /etc/fstab file:

code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate--------------------------------------------------------------------
code,brush:,bash;,collapse:,false;,title:,;,wrap-lines:,false;,notranslate
<gluster IP>:/glustervol /mnt/gluster glusterfs defaults,_netdev 0 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------

+
What were the specific issues that required SELinux to be disabled?
+
For mounting the gluster volume, perhaps show /etc/fstab (since mount -t
won’t be persistent)
+
And for using glusterfs to back Nova instances, does this mean that a
single base image in /var/lib/nova/instances/_base would be shared among
multiple compute nodes? (Side benefit of this is that only a single
retrieval from glance is needed even if the same base image is launched
on multiple Compute Nodes, right?)
+
Finally… Does having a gluster backed Nova instance store allow you to
do live migration of VMs or is that restricted to only when Nova/Cinder
volumes are used for guest boot disks?

In order to run with selinux in enforcing mode (which I agree is the
right thing to do) see this bug (in particular comment 6 and 7)

There is a problem that prevents /etc/fstab from working on boot.
gluster comes up after netfs. The problem is documented here:
+
https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/solutions/101223[https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/solutions/101223]
+
There is a solution for Red Hat Storage build clients, but not for RHEL
6.4. Obviously this is something a real system would need because the
file system needs to come up before nova-compute does or there will be
errors. As a temporary work around you can add this line to
/etc/init.d/openstack-keystone at line 95 (i will paste the line before
it and after it for context):
+
echo -n $”Starting $prog: ” +
 mount -t glusterfs 192.168.50.223:/testvol /mnt/gluster/ &>
/tmp/error_keystone_gluster.log +
 daemon –user keystone –pidfile $pidfile “$exec –config-file $config
&>/dev/null & echo \$! > $pidfile”
+
Then reboot the system. When it comes back up run:
+
yum install policycoreutils-python +
 grep -i mount /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mountallow +
 semodule -i mountallow.pp
+
That should work.

For those looking to mount Red Hat Storage from Fedora note this:
+
http://www.gluster.org/2012/05/upgrading-to-glusterfs-3-3-0/[http://www.gluster.org/2012/05/upgrading-to-glusterfs-3-3-0/]
+
\1) GlusterFS 3.3.0 is not compatible with any earlier released
versions. Please make sure that you schedule a downtime before you
upgrade.
+
Fedora 17 is running 3.2.7 and Red Hat Storage is running 3.3.0. The
gluster client on Fedora would have to manually be upgraded, or the NFS
client could be used.

John,
+
I think you have a typo in the following command:
+
gluster volume create testvol:/exp1
+
# gluster volume create testvol:/exp1 +
 Usage: volume create [stripe ] [replica ] [transport ] …
+
The correct command, in this case, would be:
+
# gluster volume create testvol myhost:/exp1 +
 Creation of volume testvol has been successful. Please start the volume
to access data.
+
I added myhost to /etc/hosts before running the command.
+
I’ll let you know if I find anything else as I go through the
instructions.
+
Thanks, +
 Marcelo
